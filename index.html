<p>Infinati's new single 'Keep it Heady' is self-explanatory. Stay in a good vibration and beautiful things will unfold. As always I encourage you to listen with your eyes closed, pry open your third eye, and have an entheogenic journey.
<p>
I had a lot of fun producing this and recording the sample you hear, 'Keep it Heady', as well as collaborating with sweetman.eth on this custom smart contract.
<p>
Upon purchasing this NFT not only do you support Infinati and sweetman.eth with some food in our bellies, but Infinati will airdrop a free music NFT for you. Previous holders may already hold this free NFT, so in the event that the supply of 50 runs out, you'll just get the next free music NFT that I mint! Reach out to @infinatimusic on Twitter so I airdrop it to the correct address and so we can stay in touch. :)
<p>
Endless love to everyone. Infinati is here to stay. Music is my first love, I'm basically married to it.</p>
