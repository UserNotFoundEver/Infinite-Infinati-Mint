# Infinite-Infinati-Mint 8/18/22
Extremely simple example of a custom music nft smart contract written by [@SweetmanTech](https://github.com/SweetmanTech) on Github

# 
I may expand upon this simple index.html later on, but for now I simply embedded the Music NFT. As a matter of fact, I hard coded it in Notepad to challenge my "coding" skills. Yes HTML is very easy to me, but still an essential piece of many puzzles on the internet.

# 
This is a smart contract with a lot of music nft metadata, unlike other mints where it's just the track and a description. Like I said, this is just a test. See the real example for itself on Github https://github.com/SweetmanTech/infinatimusic-music-nft 

# 
For simplicity's sake, I will keep this repository simple, but I may come back and make it look nicer, etc. Waiting on an API key from OpenSea.

# 9/19/22 Update
I tried to use Piñata to store the index.html on IPFS. This was done for basic experimental purposes. Here are the broken results. However, HTML and other code can be stored on IPFS, but as of now the OpenSea embed option can't be minted. In theory it makes sense, you can't store an existing NFT on IPFS and in many cases it may seem unethical. With that said it's my music and I am simply experimenting. This was not the point of the project, but now I know further possibilities! Here's the failed example where IPFS on Pinñta didn't fully mint the current index.html file of this, but it minted all the other HTML. https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPqoPXERN5qfz6RM34dhdKMnHZPNPFZN6yvxKnkupWFgR/

I say the experiment was successful as this was my first time storing code on IPFS. I am a very abstract thinker, so thus my experiments in Truth may seem absurd, but I know the path I'm going is the correct one. Like rappers say, I found my own lane, but in blockchain it's infinite lanes so to speak.

Some slight humor, the Piñata URL doesn't support the letter ñ. 

9/19/22 Update #2 SOLUTION!
With the help of Piñata, using a public IPFS getaway is the reason it didn't work. You have to use a dedicated one. I would post a link but Piñata reached out with the solution, and I believe it's only fair if I pay $20 for the service. Likewise, I am not bound to one service but will always appreciate the help since I'm still testing things. With that said, the index.html file DOES embed my music NFT, so YES, you can store any type of code on IPFS using the right methods. This still wasn't the ENTIRE point of this Repository, but I'm glad what I was trying to do isn't impossible. The word itself says "I'm possible!".

In my head I already have another solution to another experiment.
