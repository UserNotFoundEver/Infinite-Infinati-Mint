Extremely simply example of a custom music nft smart contract written by @sweetman_eth -

I may expand upon this simple index.html later on, but for now I simply embedded the Music NFT. As a matter of fact, I hard coded it in Notepad to challenge my "coding" skills. Yes HTML is very easy to me, but still an essential piece of many puzzles on the internet.

This is a smart contract with a lot of music nft metadata, unlike other mints where it's just the track and a description. Like I said, this is just a test. See the real example for itself.

For simplicity's sake, I will keep this repository simple, but I may come back and make it look nicer, etc.
